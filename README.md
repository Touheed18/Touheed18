## Hi there 👋 In-Stock Manager at Amazon | FBA Inventory Expert | Optimizing FBA Inventory & Supply Chain | Aspiring Business Analyst | Proficient in Excel, SQL, Power BI | Passionate About Turning Data into Business Solutions ##

## About Me ##

I'm Mohammed Touheed Shariff, an aspiring Data Analyst with 6+ years of professional experience in inventory management and operations, now transitioning into the data analytics field. Recently certified as a Data Analyst (Gold Category) from SkilloVilla, I'm combining my strong business acumen with newly acquired technical skills to pursue a career in data-driven decision-making and business intelligence.

## My Transition Journey ##

My career at Amazon Seller Services as an In Stock Manager has given me invaluable exposure to the power of data in driving business outcomes. Managing multi-category inventory across the FBA platform, I've achieved a 98% in-stock rate and reduced processing time by 15% through data-driven forecasting and classification systems. These experiences sparked my passion for analytics and motivated me to formalize my technical skills through professional certification.

I've successfully led initiatives resulting in 20% performance improvement and maintained a 90% retention rate, demonstrating my ability to translate insights into action. My hands-on experience with SQL-based reporting systems and Excel automation has reduced monthly reporting time by 30%, giving me practical understanding of how analytics transforms operations.

## Technical Skills & Certification ## 
Recently Certified: Data Analyst (Gold Category) from SkilloVilla with 70-79% performance, covering:

Data Analysis & Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook) for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and building automated pipelines. I've developed data cleaning procedures and transformation functions for analytical workflows.

Business Intelligence: Power BI for dashboard design, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations. I create KPI tracking systems that translate data into actionable insights.

Database Management: SQL for query optimization, ETL operations, and database analysis. Experience building reporting systems that integrate multiple data sources.

Advanced Excel: Proficiency in advanced formulas, pivot tables, and automated dashboards for rapid analysis and reporting.

## Hands-On Project Portfolio ## 
To solidify my transition into data analytics, I've completed several comprehensive projects:

ShopNest E-commerce Analytics Dashboard: Built a Power BI dashboard analyzing $15.40M in revenue across 96,478+ orders. Tracked 8 key performance metrics including sales patterns, delivery performance, and customer behavior. Identified 21% YoY growth trends and 15% delivery improvement opportunities through data visualization and analysis.

Enterprise Data Analytics Pipeline: Developed a Python-based employee performance analysis system featuring automated data cleaning, integrated dataframes combining multiple datasets, and performance-based bonus calculation algorithms using Pandas and NumPy.

Airline Sales Analytics System: Created SQL-based multi-store performance tracking system, developing quarterly reports and identifying top revenue generators through complex database queries and data integration.

## What Sets Me Apart ##
My unique advantage is the combination of real-world business experience with formal data analytics training. I understand the business context behind the data because I've lived it. I know what questions matter to operations teams, what metrics drive decisions, and how to communicate insights that resonate with stakeholders.

I don't just analyze data—I understand the business problems it needs to solve. My 6+ years in inventory management and operations give me domain expertise that many entry-level analysts lack, while my recent certification provides the technical foundation to excel in analytics roles.

## Career Goals ##
I'm actively seeking opportunities to launch my career as a Data Analyst where I can:

Apply my technical skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI to solve complex business problems
Leverage my operational experience to provide context-rich analysis
Build scalable data solutions that drive measurable business impact
Continue learning and growing in machine learning and predictive analytics
Continuous Learning

I'm committed to staying current in the rapidly evolving analytics field through:

Advanced Power BI dashboard development
Statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques
Cloud-based data engineering solutions
Contributing to open-source data analytics projects

## Beyond the Data ## 
When I'm not working on analytics projects or expanding my technical skills, you'll find me playing billiards and snooker, traveling to new destinations, or enjoying web series. I believe in maintaining balance that fuels creativity and fresh perspectives.

## Let's Connect ##
I'm eager to discuss data analytics opportunities, collaborate on projects, or exchange ideas about the field. If you're looking for an aspiring data analyst who brings both technical skills and real-world business understanding, I'd love to connect.
